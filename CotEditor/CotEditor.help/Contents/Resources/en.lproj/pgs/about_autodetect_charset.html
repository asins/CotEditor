<h1>Use encoding declarations for encoding detection in CotEditor</h1>

<p>When the “Refer to encoding declaration in document” option is turned on in the Format settings pane, CotEditor reads the following types of encoding declarations (if present) — <code>charset=</code>, <code>encoding=</code>, <code>@charset</code>, <code>encoding:</code> and <code>coding:</code> — when opening a file. If written properly, these declarations will be used to determine the file’s text encoding.</p>
<p>A declaration can be anywhere in the document, the one either in the comment area or in a plain sentence is detected. When you want to use a phrase such as “charset=UTF-8” even though your document’s encoding is not UTF-8, you need to put an actual encoding declaration prior to the phrase, or, turn off the “Refer to encoding declaration in document” option in the Format settings.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The scope to scan declarations is limited to 2,000 characters from the head of the document.</li>
	<li>To make the detection of declarations work, you have to put an equal sign (“=”, no other characters) right after “<code>charset</code>” or “<code>encoding</code>.”</li>
	<li>The encoding name which comes after “<code>charset=</code>” or “<code>encoding=</code>” can be without double-quotes (&quot;) around.</li>
	<li>In the case there are multiple encoding declarations in your document, CotEditor uses the first one to determine the text encoding.</li>
	<li>When the encoding is declared as Shift JIS (written like <code>charset=&quot;Shift_JIS&quot;</code>), CotEditor chooses the prioritized one (the upper one in the encoding list) between “Japanese (Shift JIS)” and “Japanese (Shift JIS X0213).”<br />
